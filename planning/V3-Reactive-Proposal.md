# Razen's Reactive Model

I've been working on a refined reactive model for Razen that blends **strictness**, **simplicity**, **elegance**, and **speed** — and I wanted to share both a working example and the under-the-hood plan.

---

## 🌳 The Idea

This new model is designed around four core principles:

* **Strictness with rules**: Constraints are bound directly to state and enforced automatically.
* **Simplicity with optional ceremony**: `when` and `fallback` are recommended but not mandatory, making the syntax easy to use.
* **Elegance with declarative syntax**: The code reads like natural language, making it highly readable.
* **Speed with compiled checks**: Rules and triggers are pre-linked at compile time for optimal performance.

Additionally, **rule inheritance** ensures that effects automatically respect the state rules they are dependent on.

## 📜 Working Example — SmartTree
```markdown
class SmartTree {
var name: str
var health: int = use.state(80)
var waterLevel: int = use.state(50)
var sunlight: int = use.state(70)
var fruitCount: int = use.state(0)
var pests: int = use.state(0)
var location: str
fun init(name: str, location: str) {
    self.name = name
    self.location = location
}

rules {
    health {
        when health < 0 { }
        when health > 100 { }
        use.fallback(fun() { print("🌳 {name}'s health reading is invalid") })
    }
    waterLevel {
        when waterLevel < 0 { }
        when waterLevel > 100 { }
        use.fallback(fun() { print("💧 Water level reading invalid") })
    }
    sunlight {
        when sunlight < 0 { }
        when sunlight > 100 { }
        use.fallback(fun() { print("☀️ Sunlight reading invalid") })
    }
    fruitCount { when fruitCount < 0 { } }
    pests { when pests < 0 { } when pests > 100 { } }
}

use.effect(health) {
    when health < 30 { print("⚠️ {name} is unhealthy! Health: {health}") }
}

use.effect(waterLevel) {
    print("💧 Water level is now {waterLevel}")
}

use.effect(waterLevel, sunlight, location) {
    when waterLevel > 70 and sunlight > 80 {
        print("🌞 {name} in {location} is thriving with water {waterLevel} and sunlight {sunlight}")
    }
}

use.effect(sunlight) {
    print("☀️ Sunlight changed to {sunlight}")
    use.setState(health, health + 2)
}

use.effect(pests) {
    when pests > 50 {
        print("🐛 High pest level detected: {pests}")
        use.setState(health, health - 10)
    }
    use.fallback(fun() { print("⚠️ Pest control action blocked due to health rules") })
}

use.effect(health, waterLevel) {
    when health > 60 and waterLevel > 40 {
        use.setState(fruitCount, fruitCount + 5)
        print("🍎 {name} grew 5 fruits! Total: {fruitCount}")
    }
}

use.effect(waterLevel, sunlight) {
    print("📊 Weather update — Water: {waterLevel}, Sunlight: {sunlight}")
}

fun simulateDay() {
    print("🌱 Morning: {name} starts the day healthy at {health}")
    use.setState(waterLevel, 80)
    use.setState(sunlight, 90)
    use.setState(pests, 60)
    use.setState(health, 25)
    use.setState(waterLevel, 45)
    use.setState(sunlight, 60)
    use.setState(health, 70)
}

}
fun main() {
let mangoTree: SmartTree = SmartTree("Mango", "Hyderabad")
mangoTree.simulateDay()
}
```

## 🛠 Under-the-Hood Implementation Plan

### Core Concepts

* **ReactiveState**: The fundamental building block. It holds the `value`, `prevValue`, `type`, `name`, `rules`, and a list of `effects` that depend on it.
* **Rules**: These are predicates that are compiled and bound to a specific state. They can have an optional `fallback` function to handle violations.
* **Effects**: These are functions that contain a list of **reactive triggers** (the states they depend on) and can have an optional non-reactive context. They can also include an optional `when` condition and a `fallback` function. Effects inherit the rules from their triggers.

### Execution Flow

The process is a simple, three-step flow:

1.  A call to `use.setState()` updates the state's value.
2.  The updated value immediately runs its associated rules.
3.  The state notifies all of its dependent effects.

An effect only runs if all of the following conditions are met:

* One of its triggers has changed.
* Its `when` condition (if present) passes.
* All inherited rules from its triggers also pass.

If any of these conditions fail, the effect's `fallback` function (if present) runs instead.

### Compiler Responsibilities

The compiler plays a crucial role in enabling this model's speed:

* **Parsing Rules**: It parses the `rules {}` block to map variables and compile them into direct, efficient rule functions.
* **Parsing Effects**: It parses `use.effect()` calls to identify triggers and context, and then links them directly to the corresponding state.
* **Building a Dependency Graph**: It builds a dependency graph at compile time, allowing for O(1) effect notification.

### Performance

This approach is designed for high performance:

* **Compiled Rules**: Rules are compiled to direct boolean checks, eliminating runtime overhead.
* **Pre-linked Effects**: Effects are pre-linked to their triggers, ensuring instant notification.
* **Batch Updates**: Updates can be batched to avoid redundant effect runs when multiple states change at once.

That's the full picture — a working, readable example plus the technical plan to make it a reality.
