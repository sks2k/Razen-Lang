# Razen V3 Planning: Hook-Based Reactive Constructs

This folder contains planning notes, syntax proposals, and examples for integrating hook-based reactive constructs into Razen V3.

## Goals
- Introduce `useValidator`, `useEvent`, `useIntent` as language-native hooks
- Enable declarative, agentic CLI workflows
- Align with Razen's token and annotation rules
