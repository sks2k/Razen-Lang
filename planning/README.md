# 🔍 Phase 1: Hook Primitives Planning (Aug 22 – Sep 20)

## 🎯 Objective
Design and formalize **hook-based constructs** as native language primitives in Razen V3. These should support reactive, declarative, and modular logic across CLI, scripting, and validation contexts.

---

## 📦 Core Hook Constructs

| Hook         | Purpose                          | Example Usage                                                  |
|--------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| `useValidator` | Declarative field validation     | `hook useValidator { field: "email", rule: isEmail }`          |
| `useEvent`     | React to external/internal triggers | `hook useEvent { trigger: fileChange, action: reloadConfig }`  |
| `useTrace` / `useProfile` | Runtime introspection | `hook useTrace { scope: "auth", level: "debug" }`              |

## 🧠 Design Goals

- **Declarative Syntax**: Hooks should be readable and composable.
- **Token Alignment**: Must conform to Razen’s token and annotation rules.
- **Modular Behavior**: Hooks should encapsulate state, lifecycle, and error logic.
- **Cross-Context Usability**: Hooks should work in CLI, scripting, and agentic flows.

---

## 🧪 Tasks for This Phase

1. **Syntax Refinement**
   - Define grammar for `hook` blocks
   - Align with Razen’s token system (e.g. annotations, delimiters)

2. **Example Library**
   - Create `.razen` files for each hook type
   - Include tree-based reactive logic and CLI workflows

3. **Conflict Resolution**
   - Identify where React-style patterns break Razen rules
   - Propose alternatives or adaptations

4. **Documentation**
   - Draft this spec file (`V3_Hook_Primitives.md`)
   - Create a shared Notion or markdown doc for collaborative planning

5. **Feedback Loop**
   - Share examples with Razen creator
   - Iterate based on syntax feedback and token constraints

---

## 📌 Deliverables by Sep 20

- ✅ Planning folder in GitHub fork
- ✅ Hook spec document (`V3_Hook_Primitives.md`)
- ✅ At least 3 working examples (`tree_hooks.razen`, `validator_hooks.razen`, `cli_agent.razen`)
- ✅ Syntax notes and open questions
- ✅ Roadmap for Phase 2 implementation

## ✨ Vision Statement

> **Newly updated Razen aims to make hooks a language-native primitive—not just for UI, but for modular state, validation, and enhanced CLI and scripting. Declarative, reactive, and introspective by design. This isn’t just an update—it’s a tectonic shift. The new Razen unlocks a new phase in programming, powered by constructs that challenge convention and redefine clarity. The new wave starts here.**
